# RF-PHATE

RF-PHATE is a package which allows the user to create random forest-based supervised, low-dimensional embeddings based on the 
manifold learning algorithm described in 
[Random Forest-Based Diffusion Information Geometry for Supervised Visualization and Data Exploration](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9513749)

For up-to-date RF-PHATE code, please see https://github.com/jakerhodes/RF-PHATE.
